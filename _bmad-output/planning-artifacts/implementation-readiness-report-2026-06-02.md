**Date:** 2026-06-02
**Project:** mahalla-ovozi
**Assessor:** BMad Implementation Readiness Check
**Scope:** Historical PRD ↔ Architecture ↔ UX Design consistency validation.

## Epic Coverage Validation

**Epics & Stories document:** `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/epics.md` now exists.

This section is historical because the original assessment was run before epics were generated. Use `epics.md` for current story sequencing and FR traceability.

**Architecture FR-to-Module Coverage:**

| FR Group | Module | Status |
|---|---|---|
| FR1–6 (Signal Display) | `apps/web/.../dashboard-page.tsx`, `components/` | ✅ Mapped |
| FR7–10 (Context Drawer) | `components/context-drawer/` | ✅ Mapped |
| FR11–15 (Filtering & Search) | `components/filter-bar/`, `hooks/use-filters.ts` | ✅ Mapped |
| FR16–19 (Message Intake) | `apps/server/src/bot/`, `filters/pipeline.ts` | ✅ Mapped |
| FR20–25 (AI Classification) | `classifier/`, `keywords/` | ✅ Mapped |
| FR26–28 (Signal Storage) | `signals/`, `prisma/schema.prisma` | ✅ Mapped |
| FR29–32 (Auth & Access) | `auth/` | ✅ Mapped |
| FR33–34 (Ops Health) | `health/`, `ops/`, `delay-banner.tsx` | ✅ Mapped |

**Current status:** Epics are no longer the blocker identified by this historical report.

## 🔴 ISSUES FOUND — Action Required

### Issue 1 (RESOLVED): AntD Version Label

**Current status:** UX and Architecture now consistently specify AntD v6.

---

### Issue 2 (LOW): Virtualization Threshold Inconsistency

**Location:** PRD §Implementation Considerations vs. UX component-strategy.md

**Conflict:**
- PRD: *"Virtualized lane rendering recommended if signal count per lane exceeds ~200 items"*
- UX: *"Virtual scroll requirement: Lanes must use virtual scroll when a lane exceeds 50 cards"*

**Impact:** Architecture adopted the UX's 50-card threshold (more conservative, better UX). This is the right call — 200 items before virtualization would cause DOM bloat during 7-day range views. But the PRD's ~200 figure now disagrees with the implemented spec.

**Risk:** LOW — the threshold is an implementation detail. The 50-card threshold (from UX/Architecture) is better.

**Recommendation:** Architecture spec (50 cards) should be treated as the authoritative threshold. Optionally update PRD §Implementation Considerations from "~200 items" to "~50 items" for consistency.

---

### Issue 3 (RESOLVED): Time Range Preset Naming

**Current status:** PRD FR11 now includes Yesterday, matching Architecture, UX, and Epics.

---

### Issue 4 (LOW): Login Rate Limiting — Undocumented in PRD

**Location:** Architecture §6

**Finding:** Architecture adds **login rate limiting**: 5 attempts per username per 60-second window, HTTP 429 response.

**PRD Status:** PRD does not mention login rate limiting in NFRs or security section.

**Impact:** This is a beneficial security enhancement, but it's undocumented scope from the PRD's perspective.

**Risk:** VERY LOW — this is purely additive and improves security. No functional conflict.

**Recommendation:** No action required. Optionally document as a security hardening note in PRD NFR section for traceability completeness.

---

### Issue 5 (MEDIUM): `unsupported-screen` Component Missing from PRD

**Location:** Architecture §3 project structure; UX `responsive-design-accessibility.md`

**Finding:** Both Architecture and UX define an `<unsupported-screen>` component that shows a Cyrillic message when viewport < 1024px. PRD §Browser & Display says *"Minimum display: Laptop screen (1366×768) — layout must remain functional"* — which implies 1024px hard-blocking is a tighter constraint than the PRD's stated minimum.

**Conflict:** PRD's stated minimum is 1366×768 (functional), but UX/Architecture hard-block at <1024px. Between 1024px and 1365px, the UX spec describes a condensed layout — this range is not explicitly addressed in the PRD.

**Risk:** LOW for pilot (hokim uses 1920×1080). But technically 1366×768 should be "functional" per PRD, and the UX only defines condensed layout for 1024–1279px. There's no explicit spec for 1280–1365px behavior.

**Recommendation:** The UX spec's breakpoint strategy (condensed at 1024–1279px, standard at 1280–1439px) implicitly covers 1366×768 in the "standard" range. No implementation action needed — but PRD and UX should align on the minimum: either "1366×768 functional" (PRD) or "1024px+ functional" (UX/Arch). The UX's approach is more conservative and provides better coverage.

### Issue 6 (RESOLVED): Epics & Stories Document

**Current status:** `epics.md` has been created and should be used for implementation sequencing.

---

## Summary Assessment

### Overall Consistency Score: 🟢 VERY STRONG (with minor issues)

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| PRD completeness | ✅ 35 FRs + 16 NFRs after NFR16 accessibility update |
| Architecture covers all PRD FRs | ✅ All 35 have module mapping |
| Architecture covers all PRD NFRs | ✅ All 16 NFRs addressed (some Phase 2 deferred) |
| UX aligned with PRD journeys | ✅ All 4 journeys supported; components match FRs |
| UX aligned with Architecture stack | ✅ Aligned after AntD v6 label cleanup |
| Critical conflicts | ✅ NONE |
| Epics & Stories | ✅ CREATED — use `epics.md` for story sequencing |

### Issues by Severity

| # | Severity | Issue | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | ✅ RESOLVED | Epics & Stories created | Use `epics.md` |
| 1 | ✅ RESOLVED | AntD v6 labels aligned | No action |
| 3 | ✅ RESOLVED | `Кеча`/Yesterday aligned into PRD FR11 | No action |
| 5 | 🟡 MEDIUM | PRD min display (1366×768) vs UX/Arch hard block at <1024px | Clarify minimum; UX spec is fine |
| 2 | 🟢 LOW | Virtualization threshold: PRD says ~200, UX/Arch says 50 | Use 50 (Architecture wins) |
| 4 | 🟢 LOW | Login rate limiting not in PRD | No action needed |

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Use `epics.md` as the implementation sequencing source.
2. Run sprint planning when ready to begin story execution.
