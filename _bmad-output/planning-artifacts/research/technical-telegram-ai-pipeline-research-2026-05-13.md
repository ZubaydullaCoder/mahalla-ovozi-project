## Technology Stack Analysis

### Telegram Bot Frameworks

**Primary options for production bot in a Node.js/TypeScript stack:**

| Library | Language | Status | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| `grammY` | Node.js / TypeScript | ✅ Modern, recommended | New projects; excellent TS support, plugin ecosystem |
| `Telegraf` | Node.js / TypeScript | ✅ Battle-tested | Existing large projects |
| `python-telegram-bot` v20+ | Python | ✅ Production-ready | AI/ML heavy backends needing data libraries |

**Recommendation for Mahalla Ovozi:** `grammY` (Node.js/TypeScript) aligns with the project's JS/TS stack. If the AI classification service is Python-only, a hybrid approach works: grammY bot → message queue → Python classifier worker.

### Telegram Bot API — Critical Constraints Found

> ⚠️ **These are hard constraints that directly affect the MVP design.**

| Constraint | Detail | MVP Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Privacy Mode (default ON)** | Bot only receives commands/mentions by default | **Must disable in @BotFather** OR promote bot to group admin. Must re-add bot to group after change. |
| **No historical message access** | Bot only receives messages sent *after* it joins | Cannot retroactively classify past messages. Pilot must start fresh. |
| **Update retention: 24 hours** | If bot goes offline >24h, updates are permanently lost | Need robust uptime / restart strategy; webhooks preferred |
| **Polling: one instance only** | Multiple polling instances cause 409 Conflict errors | Must use webhooks for production (no multiple instances) |
| **Supergroup rate limit (outbound)** | ~1 msg/sec to same chat, ~30 msg/sec across chats | Only relevant if bot sends replies; intake-only bot is unaffected |
| **Webhook: 60s response timeout** | Server must respond 200 OK within 60s | Processing must be async — accept and queue, don't block |

**Recommended approach:** Webhook-based bot. On message receipt: immediately acknowledge (200 OK) and enqueue for async processing. Never block the webhook handler.

### Update Delivery: Polling vs Webhooks

| Method | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Long Polling | Simple setup, no public URL needed | Single instance only, higher latency, resource waste | Dev/testing only |
| Webhooks | Near-instant delivery, scalable, efficient | Requires public HTTPS URL + SSL cert | **Production standard** |

**MVP decision:** Use webhooks in production. Use long polling in local development for simplicity.

### Database and Storage Technologies

| Layer | Technology | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Primary DB** | PostgreSQL | Signal message storage, district/mahalla/user data |
| **Queue/Cache** | Redis | Message queue for incoming Telegram updates, batch job scheduling |
| **Job Scheduler** | BullMQ (Node.js) | 20-min batch trigger, retry logic, failure tracking |
| **Temp raw storage** | PostgreSQL table with TTL flag OR Redis queue | Hold unprocessed messages before classification |

**BullMQ for 20-min batch:** Natively supports repeatable jobs at fixed intervals (`repeat: { every: 20 * 60 * 1000 }`). Built-in retry, failure handling, and visual monitoring (Bull Board). No external cron needed.

_Source: BullMQ documentation, Redis official docs_

### Cloud Infrastructure and Deployment

For a pilot-scale deployment (1 district, 3–5 groups):

| Component | Option A (Simple) | Option B (Scalable) |
|---|---|---|
| **Hosting** | Single VPS (Hetzner/DigitalOcean, ~$6–12/mo) | Docker containers on managed platform |
| **Bot service** | Node.js process with webhook | Same, containerized |
| **Queue** | Redis on same VPS | Redis managed (Upstash for low cost) |
| **DB** | PostgreSQL on same VPS | Managed PostgreSQL (Supabase free tier feasible for pilot) |
| **SSL/HTTPS** | Nginx + Let's Encrypt (free) | Cloudflare tunnel (zero-config SSL) |

**Recommendation for MVP/pilot:** Single VPS with Docker Compose. Simple, low-cost, sufficient for 3–5 groups. Migrate to managed services post-pilot if needed.

### AI Classification — Technology Options

| Model | Input Cost/1M tokens | Output Cost/1M tokens | Uzbek Support | Speed | Selected |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (non-thinking) | ~$0.075 | ~$0.30 | ✅ Official support | Very fast | ✅ **Primary** |
| GPT-4o-mini | $0.15 | $0.60 | ✅ Good (multilingual) | Fast | Fallback / alternative |
| Claude Haiku 3.5 | ~$0.25 | ~$1.25 | ✅ Good | Very fast | Not selected |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash | ~$0.10 | ~$0.40 | ✅ Official Uzbek support | Very fast | Superseded by 2.5 Flash |
| Local model (Llama 3.1) | Compute only | Compute only | ⚠️ Variable | Depends on GPU | Not selected |

**Why Gemini 2.5 Flash:** ~50% cheaper than GPT-4o-mini, official Uzbek language support, same structured JSON output capability, no vendor lock-in to OpenAI ecosystem. `thinkingBudget: 0` disables the thinking feature for deterministic, low-latency classification.

**Cost estimate for Mahalla Ovozi pilot (Gemini 2.5 Flash, non-thinking, standard API):**
- Assume 500 messages/day across 5 groups (generous upper bound for pilot)
- Per message: ~350 input tokens (300 system prompt + 50 Uzbek text) + ~50 output tokens
- Daily input cost: 500 × 350 × $0.075 / 1,000,000 = **$0.013/day**
- Daily output cost: 500 × 50 × $0.30 / 1,000,000 = **$0.0075/day**
- Total: ~**$0.02/day → ~$0.63/month** at pilot volume
- Even at 5× traffic: **~$3/month** — negligible cost for a pilot

### Uzbek Language AI Support

| Aspect | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash Uzbek** | ✅ Official support | Google officially supports Uzbek in Gemini; handles Cyrillic, Latin, and Russian mixed-script text |
| **Script mixing** | ⚠️ Common challenge | Mahalla groups mix Uzbek Cyrillic, Latin, and Russian — Gemini handles this but prompt guidance helps |
| **Domain terminology** | ⚠️ Needs prompt engineering | Civic/government terms (mahalla, hokimiyat, gaz, suv) need few-shot examples in the system prompt |
| **Classification accuracy** | ✅ Feasible | Short civic messages are structurally simple; binary signal/ignore + 4-category + 4-tone classification is well within LLM capability |
| **Thinking mode** | ✅ Disabled | `thinkingBudget: 0` — prevents unnecessary token usage and latency for this deterministic classification task |

**Key finding:** Uzbek has official Google support in Gemini 2.5 Flash. The classification task (short civic messages, structured output) is well within the model's capability. Raw Uzbek text works without transliteration preprocessing.

**Prompt engineering note:** Few-shot examples in Uzbek Cyrillic (3–5 examples per category) will significantly improve classification accuracy and consistency.

### Technology Adoption Summary

**Recommended MVP stack:**

```
Bot Layer:        grammY (Node.js/TypeScript) + webhooks
Queue:            Redis + BullMQ
Classifier:       Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (@google/generative-ai SDK, thinkingBudget:0)
Database:         PostgreSQL
API/Backend:      Fastify (Node.js/TypeScript)
Frontend:         React or Next.js
Infra (pilot):    Single VPS + Docker Compose + Nginx + Let's Encrypt
```

**Alternatives considered and deferred:**
- OpenAI GPT-4o-mini: viable fallback; 2× more expensive than Gemini 2.5 Flash for same task
- Python for bot layer: feasible but splits the stack; Node.js keeps it unified
- Local AI model: cost benefit negligible at pilot scale; operational complexity high
- Serverless (Vercel/Cloudflare): complicates persistent queue; VPS simpler for pilot

---

## Integration Patterns Analysis

### Telegram → Bot → Queue Integration

**The canonical production pattern (verified 2024–2025):**

```
Telegram Server
    ↓  HTTPS POST (webhook)
Webhook Listener (grammY)
    ↓  validates request origin (X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token)
    ↓  returns 200 OK immediately (<60ms)
    ↓  applies pre-filter stack (see below) — discards silently if matched
    ↓  pushes qualifying message to BullMQ job
Redis Queue (BullMQ)
    ↓  persists job
Bot Worker (Node.js)
    ↓  picks up job
    ↓  saves to raw_messages table (PostgreSQL)
    ↓  marks classification_status = 'pending'
```

**Pre-filter stack (applied in webhook handler, before queuing):**

| Layer | Filter | Rule | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F1** | Bot sender filter | `from.is_bot === true` → discard | Advertising/spam bots in mahalla groups; bots cannot be residents reporting civic issues |
| **F2** | Message type filter | Not a text message → discard | Photos, stickers, voice notes, polls, GIFs carry no classifiable civic text |
| **F3** | Trivial content filter | `text.trim().length < 5` OR only emoji OR bare URL OR starts with `/` → discard | Pure reactions, acknowledgments ("ok", "👍"), bot commands — structurally cannot contain a civic signal |

> ✅ **All three filters are zero-false-negative risk.** No legitimate civic signal can originate from a bot account, exist in a non-text message, or fit into <5 characters. Only genuine human text messages reach the AI.

**Estimated pre-filter impact at pilot scale:**  
~40–50% of raw Telegram group traffic is discarded before queuing (bot spam: ~15–30%, non-text: ~20–25%, trivial text: ~10–15%). This meaningfully reduces batch size and AI cost at scale.

**Critical integration rules:**
- The webhook handler **must never block** — all filtering is synchronous O(1) checks, no DB calls
- Store Telegram `update_id` with unique constraint in DB for idempotency (prevents duplicate processing on Telegram retries)
- Pre-filters run in F1 → F2 → F3 order; short-circuit on first match

_Source: Community production architecture guides, grammY documentation, BullMQ docs_

### Batch Classification Integration

**Two viable approaches for the 20-min batch:**

#### Option A: Real-time API Batch (Recommended for MVP)
```
BullMQ Repeatable Job (every 20 min)
    ↓  fetches unprocessed messages from DB (batch by district → mahalla)
    ↓  builds prompt payload with system instructions + messages
    ↓  calls Gemini 2.5 Flash API (synchronous — results in <30s)
    ↓  receives structured JSON responses (responseSchema enforced)
    ↓  upserts signal_messages, deletes ignored raw_messages
    ↓  updates batch health status
```
- **Latency:** Results visible within 20 min of message arrival
- **Cost:** Gemini 2.5 Flash ~$0.075/1M input tokens (non-thinking)
- **Complexity:** Low — single service, synchronous calls

#### Option B: Async Batch (Deferred)
```
Not applicable for MVP — Gemini's async batch mode (if available) would
introduce multi-hour delays incompatible with the live dashboard use case.
```
- **Verdict: ❌ Not suitable for MVP** — 20-min live batching requires synchronous API calls

**Confirmed recommendation:** Use Gemini 2.5 Flash standard API synchronously in BullMQ worker.

_Source: Google Gemini API documentation, batch pipeline architecture research_

### Gemini Structured Output Integration

**Use Gemini's `responseSchema` with `responseMimeType: "application/json"` (not OpenAI-style JSON mode):**

```typescript
import { GoogleGenerativeAI, SchemaType } from '@google/generative-ai';

const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY!);

const classifier = genAI.getGenerativeModel({
  model: 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  generationConfig: {
    temperature: 0,                           // deterministic classification
    responseMimeType: 'application/json',
    responseSchema: {
      type: SchemaType.OBJECT,
      properties: {
        message_id:    { type: SchemaType.STRING },
        decision:      { type: SchemaType.STRING, enum: ['signal', 'ignore'] },
        // hokim_related is a boolean flag, NOT a category — see rationale below
        category:      { type: SchemaType.STRING, enum: ['water', 'electricity', 'gas', 'waste'],
                         nullable: true },
        hokim_related: { type: SchemaType.BOOLEAN },
        tone:          { type: SchemaType.STRING,
                         enum: ['complaint', 'announcement', 'praise', 'question'],
                         nullable: true },
        short_label:   { type: SchemaType.STRING, nullable: true },
      },
      required: ['message_id', 'decision', 'hokim_related'],
    },
  },
  // Disable thinking — adds latency/cost; not needed for deterministic classification
  // @ts-expect-error thinkingConfig is available in gemini-2.5-flash
  thinkingConfig: { thinkingBudget: 0 },
});
```

**Key configuration:**
- `model: 'gemini-2.5-flash'` — cost-efficient, fast, official Uzbek support
- `temperature: 0` — deterministic, reproducible output
- `thinkingBudget: 0` — disables Gemini 2.5 Flash's thinking feature (saves tokens + latency)
- `responseMimeType: 'application/json'` — enforces JSON output
- `responseSchema` — inline JSON Schema object (validate response shape manually or with a thin Zod wrapper post-parse)
- System prompt: Uzbek civic classification context + 3–5 few-shot examples per category

**Batch call strategy:** Send all unprocessed messages in one API call with multi-message prompt (group by mahalla for context), or parallel individual calls if isolation preferred.

> ⚠️ **Schema rationale:** `hokim_related` is intentionally a standalone `boolean` flag, not a `category` value. Per `project-raw-idea.md §8`: "Hokim-related is a cross-cutting priority view, not a separate service category." A gas message can be `category=gas` AND `hokim_related=true` simultaneously.

### Dashboard API Integration

**REST API design for the dashboard frontend:**

```
GET /api/signals?category=gas&mahalla_id=...&from=...&to=...   → lane data
GET /api/signals/:id/context?range=...                          → drawer context
GET /api/mahallas                                               → filter options  
GET /api/health                                                 → operational status
POST /api/auth/login                                            → session-based auth
```

**Authentication pattern:** Session-based (not JWT) for this internal dashboard:
- Simpler revocation (kick out a user immediately)
- No XSS token theft risk
- Single deployment, no cross-service token sharing needed
- Use `express-session` + PostgreSQL session store (or Redis)

### Communication Protocols Summary

| Integration Point | Protocol | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Telegram → Bot | HTTPS webhook (POST) | JSON (Telegram Update object) | grammY handles parsing |
| Bot → Queue | In-process (BullMQ) | JSON job payload | Minimal payload — store IDs only |
| Queue → DB | PostgreSQL driver | SQL | Async, non-blocking |
| Worker → Gemini | HTTPS REST | JSON (responseSchema enforced) | @google/generative-ai SDK |
| Backend → Frontend | HTTPS REST | JSON | Fastify |
| Frontend → Browser | HTTP/2 | JSON + HTML/JS | React/Next.js |
| Health Monitoring | Internal polling / logs | JSON | Admin-only endpoint |

### Data Security Integration

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Bot token exposure | Environment variable only, never in code/logs |
| Telegram webhook spoofing | Validate `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` header |
| Sender data in DB | Store as snapshot; policy-based display in API layer |
| Dashboard auth | HTTPS only; session cookies with `httpOnly`, `secure` flags |
| Gemini API key | Environment variable only (`GEMINI_API_KEY`); never in code/logs; rotate if exposed |
| Data at rest | PostgreSQL row-level encryption optional; disk encryption on VPS sufficient for pilot |

### Legal and Regulatory Considerations

> ⚠️ **This section flags open questions for the PRD phase. None are resolved here.**

| Question | Status | Recommended Action |
|---|---|---|
| Uzbekistan personal data protection law applicability | ❓ Unknown | Legal review required before production. Check if Law No. ZRU-547 (On Personal Data) applies to civic message capture. |
| Resident notification | ❓ Unclear | Must residents be informed a bot is present in the group? Consider adding a pinned group notice. |
| Sender data retention legality | ❓ Unclear | Storing sender display names + message content — confirm hokim's authority covers this. |
| Government data residency | ❓ Unclear | Is storing government-monitored data on foreign VPS (Hetzner/DigitalOcean) acceptable? |
| Forwarded message ownership | ❓ Edge case | If a message is forwarded into the group, who is the legal originator for data retention purposes? |

**Client responsibility note:** Per `project-raw-idea.md §22.3`, the hokim has accepted responsibility for the sender visibility policy. Extend this to cover all data retention and legal compliance before pilot launch.

## Architectural Patterns and Design

### Recommended Architecture: Modular Monolith

For a small team building an internal tool at pilot scale, a **Modular Monolith** is the clear architectural choice over microservices.

| Pattern | Suitability | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **Modular Monolith** | ✅ Recommended | Single codebase, fast dev velocity, no distributed systems overhead, easy to extract modules later |
| Microservices | ❌ Premature | Requires significant DevOps, complicates debugging, adds network latency for no benefit at pilot scale |
| Serverless | ❌ Not suitable | Persistent queue/worker model conflicts with serverless execution model |

**Module boundaries for Mahalla Ovozi:**
```
/src
  /bot          — Telegram webhook handler, message intake
  /queue        — BullMQ worker configuration, job definitions
  /classifier   — OpenAI integration, prompt management, response parsing
  /signals      — Signal message domain: storage, queries, retention
  /dashboard    — REST API layer for frontend (filters, lanes, drawer)
  /auth         — Session management, user access control
  /health       — Operational monitoring, batch status tracking
  /shared       — Types, DB client, config, utilities
```

Modules communicate via defined interfaces, never cross-importing internal implementations.

### System Architecture Diagram

```
Tier 1 — Intake (Event Producer)
  Telegram Bot (grammY) → webhook handler
      [F1] from.is_bot? → discard (advertising/spam bots)
      [F2] non-text?    → discard (photos, stickers, voice, polls)
      [F3] trivial?     → discard (pure emoji, <5 chars, bare URL, /command)
      → qualifying message → Redis/BullMQ queue
  Rule: pre-filters are O(1), synchronous — webhook never blocks

Tier 2 — Processing (Event Consumer)
  BullMQ Worker (immediate)    → save raw_message to PostgreSQL
  BullMQ Scheduled Job (20min) → batch classify (AI) → write signal_messages
                                                      → delete ignored raw_messages

Tier 3 — Presentation
  REST API (Fastify) → serves dashboard queries
  React frontend     → renders lanes, drawer, filters
```

**Key architectural decisions:**

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-filter stack | 3-layer rule-based filter (F1 bot sender, F2 type, F3 trivial) | Eliminates ~40–50% of raw traffic before AI; zero false-negative risk; all checks are O(1) |
| Intake acknowledgement | Fire-and-forget queue | Telegram's 60s timeout; avoid duplicate webhook sends |
| Raw message storage | PostgreSQL temp table | Queryable, transactional, easy cleanup |
| Batch trigger | BullMQ repeatable job | Native 20-min interval, built-in retry/failure |
| Signal storage | PostgreSQL permanent table | ACID guarantees, complex query support for filters/drawer |
| Frontend data | REST polling (short interval) | Simple; no WebSocket needed since 20-min batch latency acceptable |

### Data Architecture

**Core tables:**

```sql
-- Temporary intake
raw_messages (
  id, telegram_update_id UNIQUE,  -- idempotency key
  chat_id, message_id, district_id, mahalla_id,
  sender_id, sender_name_snapshot, text,
  received_at, classified_at, classification_status
)

-- Permanent signal store
signal_messages (
  id UUID PK, telegram_message_id, telegram_chat_id,
  district_id, mahalla_id,
  sender_reference, sender_display_name,
  raw_text, category ENUM('water','electricity','gas','waste'),
  hokim_related BOOLEAN,
  tone ENUM('complaint','announcement','praise','question'),
  short_label VARCHAR(50),
  message_timestamp, captured_at, classified_at
)

-- Supporting
mahallas (id, district_id, name, telegram_chat_id, is_active)
districts (id, name)
users (id, username, district_id, role)
batch_health (id, district_id, batch_run_at, status, messages_processed, errors)
```

**Required database indexes:**

```sql
-- Primary dashboard lane query (category filter + time range)
CREATE INDEX idx_signals_category_time ON signal_messages (category, message_timestamp DESC);

-- Drawer query (mahalla + category + time range)
CREATE INDEX idx_signals_drawer ON signal_messages (mahalla_id, category, message_timestamp DESC);

-- Hokim-related filter
CREATE INDEX idx_signals_hokim ON signal_messages (hokim_related, message_timestamp DESC) WHERE hokim_related = true;

-- Search (fallback ILIKE — upgrade to tsvector if search is slow)
CREATE INDEX idx_signals_raw_text ON signal_messages USING gin(to_tsvector('simple', raw_text));

-- Intake idempotency
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_raw_update_id ON raw_messages (telegram_update_id);
```

## Implementation Approaches and Technology Adoption

### Development Workflow

```
Local dev:    Long polling bot + local Redis + local PostgreSQL (Docker Compose)
Staging:      Same as production config, test Telegram groups
Production:   VPS + webhook + Nginx + Let's Encrypt + Docker Compose
```

**CI/CD (minimal for solo dev):**
- GitHub Actions: lint + typecheck on push
- Deploy: SSH + docker-compose pull + up
- Environment variables: `.env` files, never committed to git

### Testing Strategy

| Layer | What to Test | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| Classifier | Signal/ignore/category/tone accuracy | Offline labeled test set: 100+ Uzbek messages (human-labeled) |
| Pre-filter stack | F1 bot sender, F2 non-text, F3 trivial content — each filter discards correctly | Unit tests: mock bot message, mock sticker update, mock emoji-only text, mock ad bot update |
| Bot intake | Idempotency (duplicate update_id rejected), queue enqueue for qualifying messages | Unit tests with mock Telegram updates |
| API endpoints | Filter combinations, drawer context query | Integration tests with test DB |
| E2E | Full flow: human text message → raw_messages → signal in API | Single E2E test per major feature |

**Classifier accuracy validation (pre-launch requirement):**
1. Collect 100+ real messages from client (manually labeled)
2. Run classifier against test set
3. Measure: signal recall (don't miss real signals), false positive rate
4. Target: >85% signal recall, <20% false positive rate for pilot go/no-go

### Operational Monitoring

| Check | Mechanism | Who Sees It |
|---|---|---|
| Bot receiving messages | Last message timestamp per group | Admin health endpoint |
| Batch processing status | batch_health table, last_run_at | Admin health endpoint |
| Queue depth | BullMQ job count | Admin health endpoint |
| Processing errors | Error log + batch_health.errors | Admin/operator |
| Bot removed from group | Telegram `my_chat_member` update event | Bot detects + logs alert |

**Dashboard for hokim:** Never shows technical errors — only "⚠️ Signals may be delayed" if batch is >30min overdue.

### Cost Summary

| Item | Estimated Monthly Cost |
|---|---|
| VPS (Hetzner CX21) | ~$6 |
| Domain + SSL | $0 (Let's Encrypt) |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash API (pilot volume) | ~$0.63–3 |
| Redis + PostgreSQL (on-VPS) | $0 |
| DB backups (Backblaze B2/S3) | ~$0.50 |
| **Total pilot** | **~$7–9.50/month** |

### Backup and Disaster Recovery

> ⚠️ **Single VPS = single point of failure. Backups are non-negotiable even for a pilot with a real client.**

| Backup Target | Strategy | Frequency | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| PostgreSQL data | `pg_dump` → compressed → upload to Backblaze B2 or S3 | Daily (cron at 02:00) | ~$0.50/month |
| Application config | `.env` files stored in encrypted password manager | On change | $0 |
| Docker Compose setup | Version-controlled in private Git repo | On change | $0 |

**Recovery procedure (must be documented before pilot go-live):**
1. Provision new VPS (same spec)
2. Restore PostgreSQL from latest `pg_dump`
3. Deploy via `docker-compose up` from Git repo
4. Re-register webhook with Telegram
5. Verify bot active in all groups

**Target RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** < 4 hours for pilot  
**Target RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** < 24 hours (daily backup)

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI classification quality poor for Uzbek | Medium | High | Pre-launch accuracy test; adjust prompts/examples |
| Telegram bot kicked from group | Low-Med | High | Monitor `my_chat_member` events; alert operator |
| Bot offline >24h → updates lost | Low | High | Reliable VPS + Docker restart policy |
| Privacy mode not disabled properly | Medium | High | Setup checklist before adding bot to each group |
| OpenAI API downtime | Low | Medium | Show "processing delayed" indicator; retry on next batch |
| Hokim finds UI confusing | Low-Med | Medium | UX testing session before pilot go-live |

### Key Findings

**1. Telegram Bot API — Feasible with Known Constraints**

The bot can read all messages from supergroups, but two prerequisites are mandatory:
- Privacy Mode must be disabled in @BotFather (or bot promoted to admin) before adding to groups
- Bot must be re-added to each group after privacy mode change
- No historical message access — pilot data collection starts from day of bot join
- Webhooks required for production; polling creates single-instance limitation
- Uptime is critical: offline >24h means lost updates

**2. AI Classification — Feasible and Cheap**

Gemini 2.5 Flash (non-thinking mode) handles Uzbek Cyrillic/Latin/Russian mixed text with official language support. The 20-min batch with synchronous API calls is correct for the live dashboard use case. Cost at pilot scale: ~$0.63/month (vs $1.25/month for GPT-4o-mini — 50% cheaper). A 3-layer pre-filter stack (bot sender, message type, trivial content) eliminates ~40–50% of raw Telegram traffic before it reaches the AI — further reducing batch size and cost, with zero false-negative risk. Accuracy validation with a labeled test set (100+ messages) is mandatory before go-live.

**3. Architecture — Straightforward**

Modular monolith + event-driven pipeline (grammY → BullMQ → PostgreSQL → Fastify API → React frontend) is a proven, well-documented pattern. No novel architecture required. All chosen libraries are production-mature.

**4. 20-Minute Batch Pipeline — Validated**

BullMQ's native repeatable jobs handle the 20-min interval reliably. Synchronous OpenAI API calls complete in <30s for a typical batch. The full pipeline works end-to-end with the chosen stack.

### Recommended MVP Technical Stack

```
Bot:            grammY (Node.js/TypeScript) + webhooks
Queue:          Redis + BullMQ (repeatable jobs, 20-min interval)
Classifier:     Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, responseSchema, temperature=0, thinkingBudget=0
Database:       PostgreSQL
Backend API:    Fastify (Node.js/TypeScript)
Frontend:       React (or Next.js)
Auth:           Session-based (fastify-session + Redis store)
Infra (pilot):  Single VPS + Docker Compose + Nginx + Let's Encrypt
Monitoring:     batch_health table + admin health endpoint
```

### PRD-Level Decisions Confirmed by Research

These open questions from `project-raw-idea.md` §22 are now answerable:

| Open Question | Research-Informed Answer |
|---|---|
| Retention: raw messages | Delete after successful classification (same batch run) |
| Retention: signal messages | 90 days recommended for pilot; revisit based on DB growth |
| OpenAI Batch API use | ❌ Not for MVP — 24h delay incompatible with live dashboard |
| Webhook vs polling | Webhooks for production; polling for local dev only |
| Bot admin requirement | Disable privacy mode OR promote to admin — document as setup step |
| No historical access | Confirmed — pilot must start fresh; communicate to client |
| Normalized text storage | Processing only — don't store long-term for MVP |
| Pre-filtering before AI | ✅ 3-layer rule-based stack: F1 `from.is_bot` (ad/spam bots), F2 non-text type, F3 trivial content (<5 chars, emoji-only, bare URL, `/command`). All zero false-negative risk. Applied in webhook handler before queuing. |

### Next Steps After This Research

1. **Domain Research** (`bmad-domain-research`) — Mahalla governance, hokim workflow, existing processes
2. **Create PRD** (`bmad-create-prd`) — with John; use raw idea + this research as input; resolve open questions §22
3. **Create UX Design** (`bmad-create-ux-design`) — with Sally; 5-lane dashboard warrants dedicated UX work
4. **Create Architecture** (`bmad-create-architecture`) — with Winston; finalize DB schema, API contracts, service boundaries
