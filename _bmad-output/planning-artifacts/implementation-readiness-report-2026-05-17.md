## Step 2: PRD Analysis

### Functional Requirements

FR1: Authorized users can view civic signal messages organized into five category lanes (Hokim-related, Water, Electricity, Gas, Waste) on a single dashboard.

FR2: Authorized users can scroll each lane independently without affecting other lanes.

FR3: Authorized users can see a signal count per lane.

FR4: Authorized users can see each signal item displaying: timestamp, sender reference, mahalla/group name, raw message snippet, tone badge, and hokim-related indicator.

FR5: Authorized users can see the dashboard default to Today's signals across all mahallas, sorted newest-first.

FR6: Authorized users can see a non-technical status indicator when signal data is delayed due to processing issues.

FR7: Authorized users can select any signal item to open a context drawer.

FR8: The context drawer displays signals from the same mahalla, same category, and selected time range as the clicked signal.

FR9: The selected signal message is automatically highlighted and visually distinguished within the drawer.

FR10: The context drawer remains open while the main dashboard lanes remain visible and scrollable.

FR11: Authorized users can filter all lanes by time range using presets (Last 1h, 3h, 6h, Today) and a custom range up to 7 days.

FR12: Authorized users can filter all lanes by mahalla (All or a specific monitored mahalla).

FR13: Authorized users can search across visible signal items by raw message text, sender reference, and mahalla name.

FR14: When mahalla filter is set to All, lanes display signals from all monitored mahallas.

FR15: When a specific mahalla is selected, all lanes display only signals from that mahalla.

FR16: The system captures in-scope text messages sent to monitored Telegram supergroups via an official Telegram bot.

FR17: The system captures message metadata: Telegram message ID, chat/group ID, sender reference, sender display name snapshot, and timestamp.

FR18: The system detects when the bot is removed from or loses access to a monitored group and alerts the operator.

FR19: The system ignores non-text Telegram updates (photos, videos, voice, stickers, polls) for MVP unless Architecture explicitly decides to include text captions as in-scope text.

FR20: The system processes captured messages in batches at a configurable interval (default: every 20 minutes).

FR21: The system applies a centralized conservative pre-filter before AI classification to remove structural noise such as bot-originated messages, unsupported non-text updates, empty text, pure emoji/reactions, and bot commands; exact thresholds must be validated with real mahalla data.

FR22: The system classifies each remaining message as signal or ignore using AI.

FR23: For signal messages, the system assigns: category (water/electricity/gas/waste), hokim-related flag, tone (complaint/announcement/praise/question), and optional short label.

FR24: The system deletes raw captured messages after successful classification in the same batch run.

FR25: The system retries failed AI classification batches automatically and surfaces a delay indicator to the dashboard.

FR26: The system stores classified signal messages with: signal ID, Telegram IDs, district ID, mahalla ID, sender reference, sender display name snapshot, timestamp, raw text, category, hokim-related flag, tone, optional short label, and processing timestamps.

FR27: The system retains signal messages for 90 days from capture date.

FR28: The system does not store ignored messages after successful classification.

FR29: Users can log in with credentials to access the dashboard.

FR30: Unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page and cannot access any dashboard content.

FR31: Authenticated users can log out and have their session invalidated.

FR32: The system enforces district-scoped data access — authenticated users only see data from their authorized district.

FR33: Operators can access an admin health endpoint showing: last successful batch time, current queue depth, bot connectivity status per monitored group, recent processing errors, and basic pre-filter discard counts useful for debugging.

FR34: The system exposes a health status to the dashboard that indicates whether signal data is current or delayed, without exposing technical details to non-operator users.

**Total FRs:** 34

### Non-Functional Requirements

NFR1: Dashboard initial page load completes in under 3 seconds on a standard office network connection.

NFR2: Lane filter and search operations produce visible results within 300ms (client-side, on already-fetched data).

NFR3: Context drawer opens within 500ms of a signal item being selected.

NFR4: Dashboard auto-refresh polling occurs every 60 seconds without perceptible page disruption or full reload.

NFR5: All dashboard traffic is served exclusively over HTTPS; HTTP requests are redirected.

NFR6: Session cookies are issued with `httpOnly` and `secure` flags; session data is never exposed to client-side JavaScript.

NFR7: Bot token, AI provider API key, and database credentials are stored in environment variables only — never in source code, logs, or version control.

NFR8: Incoming webhook requests are validated against a secret token header before processing; invalid requests are rejected without processing.

NFR9: All database data is stored with disk encryption at rest on the VPS.

NFR10: Session tokens are invalidated immediately on logout.

NFR11: The Telegram webhook endpoint maintains 99% availability during pilot operating hours; outages exceeding 15 minutes trigger an operator alert.

NFR12: The batch processing pipeline recovers automatically from transient AI API failures (up to 3 retry attempts) without operator intervention.

NFR13: Daily automated database backups complete successfully; operator is alerted on backup failure.

NFR14: No signal messages are lost due to system restarts or transient failures — the pipeline is idempotent per batch run.

NFR15: The system supports pilot load of up to 5 monitored groups and 1,000 messages/day with no architectural changes required; growth beyond this is a post-pilot concern.

**Total NFRs:** 15

### Additional Requirements and Constraints

- MVP is fixed to one district, 3-5 selected mahalla Telegram supergroups, text-only intake, AI signal filtering, five-lane dashboard, context drawer, filters, tone badges, session-based auth, and operator health monitoring.
- No additions are allowed before pilot validation; nice-to-have scope is explicitly empty.
- Product must not become a complaint portal, resolution tracker, citizen-facing chatbot, full Telegram archive, issue workflow, truth-verification system, or automated decision-making system.
- Exact AI model/provider, pricing, SDK syntax, latency, and Uzbek benchmark quality must be revalidated before Architecture is finalized.
- Telegram test group behavior must be validated before pilot launch, including privacy mode/admin requirements, captions, forwarded messages, edited messages, anonymous admins, and bot removal events.
- Centralized conservative pre-filter design and tests are required; short civic texts such as `gaz?`, `suv?`, `tok?`, and `svet?` must not be accidentally filtered without validation.
- Hokim lane behavior must use `hokim_related = true` as a cross-cutting boolean view, not a category enum.
- Dashboard is a client-side SPA; no SSR is required for MVP.
- Primary display target is a large office monitor, with laptop layout still functional; mobile browser support is not required for MVP.
- Light mode only for MVP.
- WebSocket is not required for MVP; 60-second polling is acceptable.
- Deployment direction is single VPS + Docker Compose + Nginx + Let's Encrypt + daily external `pg_dump` backups.

### PRD Completeness Assessment

The PRD is substantially complete and implementation-oriented. It includes clear product boundaries, user journeys, scoped MVP features, numbered FRs/NFRs, security requirements, reliability requirements, deployment direction, and post-research validation notes.

However, the PRD intentionally leaves several items provisional for Architecture/Implementation validation. These are not PRD defects, but they are readiness blockers for Phase 4 implementation until architecture and stories explicitly resolve or plan them.

Key PRD-level readiness risks:

- Architecture artifact is missing, so technical decisions are not yet decomposed into concrete modules, APIs, schemas, runtime topology, deployment details, and testing strategy.
- UX design artifact is missing, so dashboard layout, drawer behavior, operator health presentation, and Uzbek UI terminology are not yet specified at implementation detail.
- Epics and stories are missing, so there is no traceable implementation plan from FR/NFR coverage to developer-ready work.
- AI provider/model and classifier benchmark remain intentionally provisional.
- Telegram bot setup behavior and caption handling remain intentionally provisional.
- Pre-filter thresholds require real-data validation before hardening.

## Step 3: Epic Coverage Validation

### Epic FR Coverage Extracted

No epics and stories document exists yet. Therefore, no FR coverage mapping can be extracted.

### Coverage Matrix

| FR Number | PRD Requirement | Epic Coverage | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| FR1-FR34 | All 34 PRD functional requirements extracted in Step 2 | **NOT FOUND** | ❌ Missing |

### Missing Requirements

All PRD functional requirements are currently missing epic/story coverage because the epics and stories artifact has not been created.

Critical missing coverage:

- FR1-FR6: Signal display requirements have no epic/story coverage.
- FR7-FR10: Context drawer requirements have no epic/story coverage.
- FR11-FR15: Filtering and search requirements have no epic/story coverage.
- FR16-FR19: Telegram message intake requirements have no epic/story coverage.
- FR20-FR25: AI classification pipeline requirements have no epic/story coverage.
- FR26-FR28: Signal storage and retention requirements have no epic/story coverage.
- FR29-FR32: Access and authentication requirements have no epic/story coverage.
- FR33-FR34: Operational health requirements have no epic/story coverage.

### Coverage Statistics

- Total PRD FRs: 34
- FRs covered in epics: 0
- Coverage percentage: 0%

### Assessment

This is a hard implementation-readiness blocker. The project cannot proceed to Phase 4 implementation until epics and developer-ready stories are created and each FR has traceable coverage.

---

## Step 4: UX Alignment Assessment

### UX Document Status

Not found.

No whole UX document or sharded UX design artifact exists under `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts`.

### UX/UI Implication Assessment

UX is clearly required for this project. The PRD describes a user-facing web dashboard with five independently scrolling lanes, sticky lane headers, signal cards, count displays, filters, search, a right-side context drawer, selected-message highlighting, tone badges, hokim-related indicators, login/protected routes, a non-technical delay indicator, and an operator/admin health endpoint.

The dashboard is also explicitly intended for a busy non-technical hokim and district staff, primarily on a large office monitor. That makes UX design a core readiness artifact, not optional polish.

### Alignment Issues

UX alignment cannot be validated because both UX and Architecture artifacts are missing.

Known UX-sensitive areas that must be designed before implementation:

- Five-lane dashboard layout at 1920x1080 and 1366x768.
- Independent lane scrolling behavior.
- Signal item density, truncation, and full-text access.
- Right-side context drawer layout and selected-message highlighting.
- Time range, mahalla, and search filter placement.
- Non-technical delayed-signal indicator wording and placement.
- Operator/admin health endpoint presentation or access pattern.
- Uzbek UI terminology, preferably Uzbek Cyrillic for demo content.
- Hokim-related cross-cutting view indicator behavior.
- Empty states, loading states, and error/delay states.

### Warnings

Missing UX design is a hard readiness blocker for implementation because the main product value depends on scanability, clarity, and low-training usability for a non-technical leadership user.

Recommendation: create the UX design artifact before Architecture, so layout, interaction, and state requirements can inform API shape, data loading, performance choices, and story breakdown.

---

## Step 5: Epic Quality Review

### Epic Document Status

Not found.

No epics and stories artifact exists under `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts`.

### Quality Review Result

Epic quality cannot be evaluated yet because there are no epics or stories to inspect.

This is not a defect in written epics; it is a missing-planning-artifact blocker.

### Best-Practice Risks to Enforce When Epics Are Created

When the epics and stories workflow is run, the resulting artifact must avoid these common problems:

- Technical milestone epics such as “Database setup,” “API development,” or “Infrastructure setup” without standalone user value.
- Forward dependencies where an earlier story requires a later story to be useful or testable.
- One large upfront database/modeling story that creates all tables before user-value stories need them.
- Vague acceptance criteria such as “user can login” without testable success and failure paths.
- Missing traceability from each FR/NFR to at least one epic/story.
- Stories that mix unrelated concerns such as Telegram intake, classification, dashboard UI, and deployment in one implementation unit.

### Recommendation for Future Epics

Create epics after UX and Architecture are available. Epics should be user-value oriented and independently useful, while still sequencing technical setup where needed.

Likely future epic areas may include:

- Authenticated dashboard access and baseline shell.
- Telegram intake and monitored group connectivity.
- Signal classification pipeline and retention behavior.
- Civic signal dashboard lanes and filters.
- Context drawer and signal inspection.
- Operational health and deployment readiness.

These are candidate areas only; final epics should be generated through the BMAD create-epics-and-stories workflow after UX and Architecture are complete.
