# Superseded Implementation Readiness Report

This file is retained only as a historical marker.

The original 2026-05-17 readiness report was generated before the current PRD, UX specification,
Phase 1 architecture, and Developer Ops Console specification were finalized. Its detailed findings
are no longer valid for current implementation planning.

Current authoritative planning sources:

- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prd.md`
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture-ops-console.md`
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification/`

Current status as of 2026-06-01:

- PRD updated for current MVP scope.
- Tone classification and tone UI are removed from MVP scope.
- Phase 1 stack is Express v4, Prisma v7, PostgreSQL, grammY, Zod v4, AntD v6, React 18, and `node-cron`.
- Historical UX HTML explorations are marked as non-authoritative.
- `.agents/skills` is the active project skill directory.

Still required before implementation:

- Create epics and developer-ready stories.
- Run a fresh implementation-readiness check against the current workspace.
