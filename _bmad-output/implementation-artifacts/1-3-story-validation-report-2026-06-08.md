# Story Validation Report: 1.3 Bot Connectivity Monitoring

Date: 2026-06-08
Status: Passed after validation edit
Story file: `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-3-bot-connectivity-monitoring.md`

## Validation Scope

- Checked Story 1.3 against Epic 1.3 acceptance criteria and FR18.
- Re-checked story guidance against architecture, PRD, current repo structure, Prisma schema, Story 1.2 implementation patterns, and sprint status.
- Verified Telegram `my_chat_member` / `ChatMemberUpdated` timestamp behavior against current Telegram Bot API and grammY reference documentation.
- Reviewed for BMAD checklist risks: wrong file locations, duplicate functionality, vague implementation instructions, missing tests, regression risk, and LLM-dev-agent ambiguity.

## Issue Fixed During Validation

1. Corrected `bot_last_seen_at` guidance to use the Telegram membership-change timestamp: `new Date(ctx.myChatMember.date * 1000)`. The previous story draft mixed the AC requirement for "event timestamp" with implementation guidance using server time.

## Final Validation Result

No remaining blockers found.

Story 1.3 is applicable and ready for `bmad-dev-story`.

## Residual Notes

- Story scope is correctly narrow: one bot handler, one co-located test file, no migrations, no new dependencies, no new routes.
- The existing codebase state matches the story assumptions: `apps/server/src/bot/index.ts` has `message` and `edited_message` handlers only; `Mahalla` already has `bot_status` and `bot_last_seen_at`; Story 1.2 is marked done.
- No application code was changed or tested in this validation pass.
